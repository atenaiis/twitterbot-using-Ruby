# twitterbot-using-Ruby


> This is a solo project with Ruby for building a bot.
- The aim of this project was to build a Twitter bot developed in Ruby
- Using two API's, to comment a tweet and to share a twit with #chocolate and to share a birth event on the current date but from a different year

# Instructios on how the Twitter bot works
If you want to have a version in your local work area:
- Need to create a developer account for Twitter. I leave the page for you to do it. [Twitter for Developers](https://github.com/atenaiis)
- You will get 4 different keys, after hiding the consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, and access_token_secret,  clone this repository on your local machine,from https://github.com/atenaiis/twitterbot-using-Ruby.git
- Rename the template.env. Its name should be just ".env"
- Replace the content of the .env using the keys provided by Twitter.
- Run the command below on your root folder to install the necessary dependencies of the project
